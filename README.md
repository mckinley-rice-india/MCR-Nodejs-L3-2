# Mckinley & Rice NodeJs Coding Challenge

> Welcome to the Mckinley & Rice Coding Challenge!


## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a  web app, and provide us the source files to be built.


This challenge is expected to take about 2-4 hours.

The [Indego GeoJSON station status API](https://www.rideindego.com/stations/json/) provides a realtime snapshot of the number of bikes available, number of open docks available (not currently containing a bike), and total number of docks at every station. This API is free and requires no API key.

The [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/current#name) provides a realtime snapshot of the current weather in a given city. Since Philadelphia is a small geographical area it is sufficient to obtain the weather for a geographical location central to Philadelphia. This API has a free plan, you will need to sign up for an API key.

Using MongoDB, Node.js, Express, [Bluebird](https://npmjs.org/package/bluebird), Lodash and the Linux, Node.js and MongoDB hosting of your choice (see below for hosting details including free options), create a new API server which accumulates data over time and provides access to historical data for both weather and Indego bike availability, supporting the following queries at minimum. Note that it is sufficient to store data at hourly intervals.

*Please note: historical CSV data downloads are available from Indego, however you should not rely on them.* Instead you should build your own node application that downloads fresh data at least once per hour, stores it and implements the API described below.

## Snapshot of all stations at a specified time

Data for all stations as of 11am Universal Coordinated Time on November 1st, 2017:

`/api/v1/stations?at=2017-11-01T11:00:00`

This API should respond as follows, with the actual time of the first snapshot of data on or after the requested time and the data:

```javascript
{
  at: '2017-11-01:T11:00:01',
  stations: { /* As per the Indego API */ },
  weather: { /* as per the Open Weather Map API response for Philadelphia */ }
}
```

If no suitable data is available a 404 status code should be given.

## Snapshot of one station at a specific time

Data for a specific station (by its `kioskId`) at a specific time:

`/api/v1/stations/KIOSKIDGOESHERE?at=2017-11-01T11:00:00`

The response should be the first available on or after the given time, and should look like:

```javascript
{
  at: '2017-11-01:T11:00:01',
  station: { /* Data just for this one station as per the Indego API */ },
  weather: { /* as per the Open Weather Map API response for Philadelphia */ }
}
```

Include an `at` property in the same format indicating the actual time of the snapshot.

If no suitable data is available a 404 status code should be given.

## Snapshots of one station over a range of times

All historical data for a specific station between two timestamps:

`/api/v1/stations/KIOSKIDGOESHERE?from=2017-11-01T11:00:00&to=2017-12-01T11:00:00&frequency=daily`

For this last response, the returned JSON value should be an array of values in ascending chronological order. **Each element in the array** should look like:

```javascript
{
  at: '2017-11-02T10:00:00',
  station: { /* snapshot in the same format as the other APIs */ },
  weather: { /* as per the Open Weather Map API response for Philadelphia */ }
}
```

The `frequency` query parameter, if present, may be `hourly` or `daily`. The API should respond with only one entry from each hour or day. For `hourly` this should be the first entry on or after the top of the hour. For `daily` it should be the first entry on or after noon, Philadelphia time. If `frequency` is absent, `hourly` is the default.

## Unit tests

All of the APIs should have unit test coverage; invoking `npm test` should test your package. We suggest [mocha](https://npmjs.org/package/mocha) but other frameworks are fine.

## Hosting details

You'll need to make your API available on a server that we can communicate with from the office, not just on your laptop. Although this is not a system administration job, we're interested in seeing that you are comfortable with the fundamentals of installing services on Linux and/or working with cloud providers like Heroku.


## Criteria

Your work will be evaluated primarily on:

* Consistency of coding style (ideally in harmony with our [JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/punkave/best-practices/blob/master/javascript.md))
* Idiomatic use of `express`, `mongodb`, `bluebird` and `lodash`
* Correct use of promises, including proper error handling. async/await may be used
* Absence of "callback hell"
* Efficient MongoDB queries
* Correct and complete unit test coverage
* General quality of code and technical communication.

## How to submit your work

Fork this project on github. When you're finished, send us the URL of your public repository and the URL of your running instance of the API. *Consider using `.gitignore` to avoid putting any deployment credentials or API key in your public repository.*

## Extra credit

* A simple front end React or Vue application, and/or Express-powered webpage, offering a visualization of all or part of the data utilizing the API you have built as a back end.
* Import the [historical data available from Indego](https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/) so that it is available via the queries above. Note that this is in addition to, not an alternative to, downloading live data periodically and adding it to your own historical database.
* Anything else you think is cool, relevant, and consistent with the other requirements.
